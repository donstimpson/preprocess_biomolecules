THE PYTHON SCRIPT CONTAINED HERE IS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT NEEDS TO ENTER A NEURAL NETWORK
DESIGNED TO WORK WITH COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY SYSTEMS (SPECIFICALLY GROMACS SYSTEMS, UNTESTED WITH OTHERS) WHILE
MAXIMIZING THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT THE FEATURES REPRESENT. IN THIS INITIAL CASE THE FEATURES ARE:
    -ATOM PARTIAL CHARGE
    -ATOM COORDINATES
    -ATOM BONDS (AS EDGES)

THIS WAS BUILT TO BE PART OF A LARGER PROJECT BUT HOPEFULLY IT CAN DO SOME GOOD SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE MEANTIME.

TO USE, FIRST GO INTO structure_parser_v1.py AND EDIT YOUR PATH TO THE ITP FILES AND THE NAME OF YOUR PDB FILE
(IF YOU DONT HAVE THESE AND DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GET THEM, YOU CAN BUILD A SYSTEM PRETTY EASILY BY GOING TO
CHARMM-GUI.ORG)
TO RUN, JUST TYPE "python structure_parser_v1.py" INTO YOUR COMMAND LINE

THE OUTPUT SHOULD SHOW A VALIDATED SQUARE ADJACENCY MATRIX AND THE CORRESPONDING SPARSE MATRIX CONTAINING VALUES
CONSISTENT WITH THE NUMBER OF ATOMS IN YOUR SYSTEM.


AS OF YET, IT HASN'T BEEN TESTED ON HETEROGENEOUS SYSTEMS BUT THAT'S NEXT ON THE LIST
